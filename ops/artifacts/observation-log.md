# LifeOS Observation Log

**Observation Window:** 2026-01-25 to 2026-02-01 (7 days)

## Instructions

1. Use LifeOS iOS app daily for:
   - Checking today's summary

   - Reviewing transactions

2. Log any issues below under the appropriate category

3. Do NOT request fixes during the observation window (unless critical data loss)

4. After 7 days, review this log to populate `ops/queue/post-usage.md`
