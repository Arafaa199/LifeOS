# Post-Usage Improvement Queue

**Created:** 2026-01-25
**Source:** Observation log findings only
**Status:** LOCKED until observation window ends (2026-02-01)

---

## Rules

1. **Only add items sourced from:**
   - `ops/artifacts/observation-log.md`
   - Actual usage pain (not theoretical improvements)
   - Missed data proofs (evidence required)

2. **Do NOT add:**
   - Feature requests without usage evidence
   - Optimizations without measured pain
   - Architecture changes without breakage proof

3. **Priority scale:**
   - P0: Data loss or corruption
   - P1: Incorrect data affecting decisions
   - P2: Friction that blocks daily use
   - P3: Annoyance but workaround exists
   - P4: Nice-to-have
